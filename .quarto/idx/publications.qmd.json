Here i list all academic papers for which i am a co-author, and describe my contribution.\n\n\nThis was my first project as a RA, a project that grew out from my bachelor thesis. I wrote all research code, wrote the paper (with input from my supervisor). Code is available [here](https://github.com/Ararder/Genetics-of-age-at-onset-in-MD).\n\n## 2. [Genetic heterogeneity and subtypes of major depression](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41380-021-01413-6)\n\nFor this paper i gave technical support. I got the fastGWA software setup, generated the genetic relatedness matrix for UKB (N=457k) for our local compute cluster. I also assisted with setting up [HDL](https://github.com/zhenin/HDL#:~:text=be%20found%20here.-,What%20is%20HDL%3F,correlation%20estimate%20by%20about%2060%25.) on the compute cluster, and provided sample scripts for running HDL over several phenotypes. Lastly, i reviewed the majority of the [research code](https://github.com/Thuy-Dung-Nguyen/MD-subtypes), refactoring some of the verbose part and catching a few minor errors.\n\n# \n"},"formats":{"html":{"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":false,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"engine":"markdown"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-yaml":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[]},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","css":["styles.css"],"output-file":"publications.html"},"language":{},"metadata":{"lang":"en","fig-responsive":true,"quarto-version":"1.0.37","editor":"visual","theme":"litera","title":"Publications","about":{"template":"jolla"}},"extensions":{"book":{"multiFile":true}}}}}
