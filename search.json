    "text": "2. Genetic heterogeneity and subtypes of major depression\nFor this paper i gave technical support. I got the fastGWA software setup, generated the genetic relatedness matrix for UKB (N=457k) for our local compute cluster. I also assisted with setting up HDL on the compute cluster, and provided sample scripts for running HDL over several phenotypes. Lastly, i reviewed the majority of the research code."
