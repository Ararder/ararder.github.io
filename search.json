I got the fastGWA software setup, generated the genetic relatedness matrix for UKB (N=457k) for our local compute cluster. I also assisted with setting up HDL on the compute cluster, and provided sample scripts for running HDL over several phenotypes. Lastly, i reviewed the majority of the research code, refactoring some of the verbose part and catching a few minor errors."
